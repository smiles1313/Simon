# Simon
An online version of the game "Simon" created using Pygame.

This was a project completed with the guidance of a mentor through MAGIC (More Active Girls in Computing) in the summer of 2019. The final product was presented at Google in San Francisco.

Simon was the first exposure I had in creating a GUI, which was done with Pygame. I struggled with the timing of the patterns being displayed and the way in which the patterns the user replicated was received. This was resolved through playing around with the clock speed and frequency of updates on user actions. The main lesson I learned through this project was the difference in code and user interaction, as well as more human elements from the coder are required to make this connection flow.
