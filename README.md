# Simon
An online version of the game "Simon" created using Pygame.

Game Description:
The game I have chosen to create is called “Simon”, and is based off the original Simon game.
There will be four different buttons on the screen, and will be accessed using the arrow keys on
the user’s keyboard. The buttons on the screen will light up in a random pattern, and the user has
to repeat that pattern correctly. If the user is successful, the pattern will get longer and only end
once the user makes a mistake. The goal of the game is for the user to complete the patterns
correctly for as long as possible.
Every level (pattern) completed will be counted as 1 point for the user. At the end of the game,
the user will be given their score and will be asked to play again or to quit the program.
